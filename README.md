My name is Kalpana, and I’m a 4th-year Computing Science student at Simon Fraser University. I love building practical, user-friendly software and enjoy working on projects that turn simple ideas into real, functional applications. I’m especially interested in full-stack development and creating experiences that feel clean, intuitive, and impactful.

When I’m not working on projects or exploring new technologies, I’m usually out on a hike or chasing my next adventure.
